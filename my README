Hi there,
Thank you so much for taking the time to go through my code, I took the whole week to complete as it has been years since i've last coded properly in python.

THE MONOPOLY GAME
-I used pycharm to complete the code but I did not include the library or venv folder - i did use python 3.12
-I created a function that chooses between rolls_1.json and rolls_2.json as i thought it was supposed to be an option given scenario.
-I would prefer if the codes are not shared and hence I have set the repository to prviate as it does contain my full name and directory.
-The directory in lines 4 and 16 were hardcoded for my directory.

With the best regards,
Gayathri
